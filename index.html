                    <p style="font-family: chomskyregular;text-align: left;font-size: 22px;">Elizabeth, I became the second queen of England on January 15th, 1559. After queen Mary I died. She was imprisoned in the Tower of London beforehand, in other words she went from a prisoner to queen overnight. In the beginning of her reign Elizabeth faced assassination attempts from her cousin, Mary Stuart, trying to take the throne from her. Throughout her reign, Elizabeth authority was challenged and people believed her to be unfit as a ruler of England in many cases as she had to deal with trifling rebellions of Irish descent.<br><br>In the 15th century, it was rare for a woman to rule alone, the only other case being the queen before her. With heavy expectations of the monarch to act she managed spectacularly as a ruler and despite facing scrutiny she managed to make England prosper for a long time. Her refusal to conform to traditional gender roles and joining her army into battle at Tilbury solidifiers her legacy as one of England’s greatest rulers.</p>

                    <p class="text-center" style="font-family: chomskyregular;color: rgb(0,0,0);font-size: 22px;">On August 9th, 1588, Queen Elizabeth on horseback gave her famous speech, To the Soldiers at Tilbury. Directly addressing the soldiers before her and to ensure a high moral. She appealed to them, “I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too.” She may be a woman, but she has every other quality of a man, no, she has the qualities fit for a ruler. She put herself in her army, despite physiology she fought with them, promised them awards. Her speech rallied the troops, and they brimmed leaking their confidence and determination at the seams as they vigilantly wipe out the Spanish Armada.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;font-family: chomskyregular;font-size: 22px;color: var(--bs-black);filter: brightness(0%);">King Phillip II of Spain in 1588 sent the Spanish Armada to depose Queen Elizabeth I. The Spanish Armada was a fleet of ships that went upward from Spain across the English Channel. The invasion prompted two main things, religion, and politics.<br><br>Religion since Phillip II was a devout Catholic. Whilst under Queen Elizabeth I rule was a Protestant rule. He looked to reform England into a catholic country. Politics since Elizabeth I supported English privateers who attacked Spanish ships. As well as support for Dutch rebels fighting Spain and Elizabeth I refusing to marry Phillip’s Catholic cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, is what caused Phillip to invade.<br><br>Phillip had reckless confidence approaching England… why? He believed that England under leadership of a female ruler made England lack stability. In his eyes a female monarch lacked conviction. Thus, he thought that he could easily usurp the throne and set up Catholicism in England.&nbsp;</p>

                <p style="font-family: chomskyregular;font-size: 22px;">Elizabeth’s speech to the Troops at Tilbury she used every literary device she could to appeal to her soldiers. Resolving herself to “in the midst and heat of the battle to live or die amongst you all, to lay down for God and for my kingdom…”&nbsp;She let her resolve shine through her speech, with every word making her glow brighter and brighter than any afternoon sun could. Despite her physicality, she chose to fight like a king, to be a king at that moment. That decisiveness and exuding confidence is what decided the Battle of Tilbury. Her country was on the line, she could have crumbled like other great monarchs, but no…<br><br>The Battle of Tilbury was more than just a confrontation between two countries. More than a clash between two religions, more than mere politics. A test for Queen Elizabeth to prove that despite being a female monarch in 15th century England Elizabeth was fit to rule England. In an age where power was exclusively in the hands of men. Where rebellions happened in her own empire she quelled them with ease. Her unwavering dedication to England, even going so far to say that she was only married to England, and to no one else. She poured her heart into her empire, a “heart and stomach of a king.”</p>
